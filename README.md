# HW09A

I originally wanted to make a transparency slider that would make the colors transparent and reveal images underneath, but I kept getting this result where if I started with full color, the slider wouldn't work at all, and if I started with transparent, moving the slider even a little would just cause all the color to become black. After a lot of time, I couldn't figure this out and honestly it was frustrating me too much, so I just shifted gears to normal color sliders, which thankfully worked as I wanted them to.

For this I started with the code we used in a previous week to tweak with, and I wanted to make it so that the image had inverted colors and then wherever the mouse was moved turned into the normal colors. At first I thought this wasn't working, but then after looking closer, I realized that it does technically work, it's just that the computer does not process the video/image fast enough for it to visually work. Instead it just kind of turns one square into normal color if you let the mouse stay still for long enough. While this is not exactly what I hoped for, I'm satisfied that at least on a technical level it worked.
